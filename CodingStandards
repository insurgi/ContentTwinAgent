Coding Standards

Introduction

These coding standards guide our XP-oriented development team in building secure applications for banking and compliance-based clients. The principles focus on code quality, security, collaboration, and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

📋 Backlog Management

We use Shortcut to manage our backlog, ensuring that all work follows a structured workflow.

LLM Prompts for Backlog Management

Prompt 1:
"Given a backlog managed in Shortcut, define the optimal workflow for starting, working on, and completing a feature. Include steps for test-driven development (TDD) and branching strategy."

Prompt 2:
"Explain the importance of creating a WIP commit before implementing a solution in TDD. How does it enforce best practices in backlog management?"

Prompt 3:
"Given a set of development tasks, classify them as a bug, chore, or feature, and explain how each should be handled in a structured backlog workflow."

Standard Workflow

Start the top unstarted story in the backlog
Branch Naming Convention:

feature/{id} for new features
bug/{id} for bug fixes
chore/{id} for maintenance tasks
TDD Workflow:

Write failing tests (WIP: Red Tests)
Implement code to make them pass (WIP: Green Tests)
Refactor and commit (Refactor complete)
Pull Request Process:

Mark story Finished, create a PR, and trigger a build
Review PRs and merge
Mark story Delivered
PM Review: Accept or reject the story
📖 Story Types & Estimation

We classify work into Features, Bugs, and Chores with point-based estimation.

LLM Prompts for Story Estimation

Prompt 4:
"Given a backlog item, determine its classification as a feature, bug, or chore. Explain the reasoning and appropriate workflow steps."

Prompt 5:
"Estimate the complexity of a given user story based on the Fibonacci scale (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8). Justify your estimate with reasoning."

Story Estimation Guidelines

0️⃣ Zero Points: Quick fixes (typos, minor UI tweaks)
1️⃣ One Point: Straightforward tasks where the solution is clear
2️⃣ Two Points: Slightly more complex but well-defined tasks
3️⃣, 5️⃣, 8️⃣ Higher Points: Large tasks—should be broken into smaller stories
🎨 Coding Style Guidelines

We enforce a consistent style for readability and maintainability.

LLM Prompts for Code Consistency

Prompt 6:
"Given a function with inconsistent naming conventions, rewrite it to follow best practices for the given programming language."

Prompt 7:
"Reformat a given block of code to enforce indentation, line length, and proper commenting."

Key Standards

Naming Conventions: Use camelCase (JavaScript, Python), PascalCase (classes)
Code Formatting: Use 4-space indentation, keep lines under 80 characters
Comments: Write meaningful comments, avoid outdated ones
🧪 Testing Strategy (TDD/BDD)

We implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

LLM Prompts for Testing

Prompt 8:
"Given a function description, generate BDD-style unit tests using Mocha or Jest."

Prompt 9:
"Write an integration test that verifies the interaction between two microservices in a backend system."

Test Structure

Unit Tests (BDD-style frameworks like Mocha, Jasmine)
Integration Tests (Ensuring components work together)
Functional Tests (API Testing)
Test Suites (Separate unit, integration, and functional tests)

Example BDD Test (Jest/Mocha):
describe('Calculator', () => {
  describe('addition', () => {
    it('should correctly add two positive numbers', () => {
      expect(add(5, 7)).to.equal(12);
    });
  });
});
